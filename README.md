## ❤️ **Heart Disease Prediction**
***
📌 **Overview**
---
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using various health metrics. By applying data preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms, we can identify individuals at higher risk and potentially aid early medical intervention.
***
🧠 **Objective**
---
Analyze patient health records

Build a classification model to predict heart disease presence

Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall

🧰 **Technologies Used**
---
- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

- Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation

- MLPs, RandomForestClassifier, Train-Test Split, Accuracy Score

***
📊 **Dataset**
The dataset includes various attributes such as:
---
- Age

- Gender

- Chest pain type

- Blood pressure

- Cholesterol level

- Resting ECG results

- Max heart rate achieved

- Exercise-induced angina

- ST depression

***
🔍**Key Steps**
---
- Data Exploration & Cleaning

- Checked for missing values and data types

- Explored correlations and outliers

- Data Visualization

- Visualized heart disease occurrence by age, gender, and cholesterol levels

- Modeling

- Applied Logistic Regression to classify risk

- Evaluated using confusion matrix and accuracy score

📈 Results
---
The RandomForestClassifier model achieved an accuracy of around 89%
and MLPs model achived an acuracy of around 85.3%

Key predictors: chest pain type, max heart rate, exercise-induced angina
